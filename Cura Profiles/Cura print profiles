Great — SUNLU PLA + 0.4 mm nozzle is actually an ideal combo for pushing speed and keeping quality on a Prusa-style i3.
Below are realistic, dialed-in expectations for your setup, assuming:
•	Dual-drive extruder
•	Stiffened frame + vibration isolation
•	PEI magnetic bed
•	Stock-class hotend (or mildly upgraded)
•	Proper tuning (flow, temps, accel)
________________________________________
🎯 Expected Print Speeds (SUNLU PLA, 0.4 mm)
✅ High-Quality / Daily Prints
These look as good as “normal” Prusa prints:
•	Print speed: 70–85 mm/s
•	Outer walls: 45–55 mm/s
•	Inner walls: 70–85 mm/s
•	Infill: 90–110 mm/s
•	Layer height: 0.2 mm
➡️ This is your safe, reliable sweet spot.
________________________________________
⚡ Fast Functional Prints (Still Clean)
Small loss in cosmetic quality, but very usable:
•	Print speed: 85–100 mm/s
•	Outer walls: 50–60 mm/s
•	Inner walls: 85–100 mm/s
•	Infill: 110–120 mm/s
•	Layer height: 0.24–0.28 mm
➡️ Excellent for brackets, mounts, tools, housings.
________________________________________
🚀 Speed-Focused / Draft Mode
Pushing the machine, tuning required:
•	Print speed: 100–120 mm/s
•	Outer walls: 60–70 mm/s
•	Inner walls: 100–120 mm/s
•	Infill: 120–140 mm/s
•	Layer height: 0.28–0.32 mm
➡️ Expect:
•	Slight corner rounding
•	More visible layer lines
•	Requires good cooling + temp tuning
________________________________________
🔥 Temperature Settings (Critical for Speed)
SUNLU PLA likes slightly higher temps when printing fast:
Speed Range	Nozzle Temp
60–80 mm/s	200–205 °C
80–100 mm/s	205–210 °C
100–120 mm/s	210–215 °C
💡 If extrusion looks matte or under-extruded → temp is too low for that speed.
________________________________________
🌀 Volumetric Flow Reality Check
With a 0.4 mm nozzle:
•	Comfortable volumetric flow limit on stock-ish hotend:
~8–10 mm³/s
•	That equals roughly:
o	0.2 mm layer @ ~90–100 mm/s
o	0.28 mm layer @ ~70–80 mm/s
➡️ If you push faster than this without a better hotend, quality will fall apart no matter what your slicer says.
________________________________________
⚙️ Acceleration (This Matters More Than Speed)
If you don’t change acceleration, speed gains won’t show up.
Recommended ranges:
•	Perimeters: 800–1200 mm/s²
•	Infill: 1500–2500 mm/s²
•	Travel: 2000–3000 mm/s²
If you later add input shaping / Klipper, you can safely push:
•	3000–5000 mm/s² without ringing
________________________________________
🧪 Cooling (SUNLU PLA Needs It at Speed)
For clean overhangs above 80 mm/s:
•	Part cooling fan: 100%
•	Minimum layer time: 5–8 seconds
•	If possible: upgraded 5015 fan or better duct
________________________________________
🏁 Bottom Line (Your Setup)
With SUNLU PLA + 0.4 mm nozzle:
•	Everyday clean prints: 70–85 mm/s
•	Fast functional parts: 85–100 mm/s
•	Aggressive but usable: 100–120 mm/s (tuned)
👉 The true limiter right now is volumetric flow and firmware motion control, not your extruder or frame.
________________________________________
Want a Shortcut to Even Faster Prints?
If speed becomes the priority:
•	Switch to 0.6 mm nozzle
•	Keep speeds similar
•	Prints finish 30–45% faster with minimal quality loss
If you want, tell me:
•	Slicer (PrusaSlicer / Cura / Orca)
•	Current accel & jerk
•	Hotend (stock or upgraded)
I can give you exact profile values you can drop in and print immediately.
slicer cura 5.11
Perfect 👍 — Cura 5.11 gives you very fine control, so below is a ready-to-use speed profile specifically tuned for:
•	SUNLU PLA
•	0.4 mm nozzle
•	Upgraded Prusa i3 (stiffened frame + dual drive)
•	Focus on speed without destroying quality
You can copy these values directly into Cura.

📊 What to Expect From This Profile
Metric	Result
Average Speed	85–95 mm/s
Print Time Reduction	30–40%
Surface Quality	Slightly less glossy than slow prints
Ringing	Minimal
Reliability	High
________________________________________
⚠️ If You Want Even Faster (Optional Tweaks)
🔥 Push to ~110–120 mm/s
Change only these:
•	Print Speed: 110 mm/s
•	Infill Speed: 130 mm/s
•	Nozzle Temp: 212–215 °C
•	Max Volumetric Speed: 10.5 mm³/s
If you see:
•	Clicking → lower speed or raise temp
•	Matt layers → raise temp
•	Rounded corners → lower jerk slightly

🏁 Recommendation
This Cura profile is near the practical limit for:
•	0.4 mm nozzle
•	PLA
•	Non-CoreXY bedslinger
For another big jump in speed:
•	Switch to 0.6 mm nozzle
•	OR add input shaping (Klipper / firmware)
If you want, I can:
•	Export this as a .curaprofile
•	Tune it for 0.2 mm detail prints
•	Optimize specifically for your hotend (stock vs Revo/Mosquito)


 
Here are Cura 5.11 support settings that are specifically tuned to break off cleanly by hand while still supporting overhangs reliably on PLA (SUNLU) with a 0.4 mm nozzle.
These work well with all three of your profiles.
________________________________________
🧩 EASY-REMOVAL SUPPORT SETTINGS (PLA)
🔹 Support Placement
•	Generate Support: ✅ ON
•	Support Placement: Touching Buildplate
(Use “Everywhere” only when absolutely required)
________________________________________
🔹 Support Structure
•	Support Structure: Lines
(Easiest to remove — avoid Grid for PLA)
•	Support Density: 10–12%
(Lower = easier removal)
________________________________________
🔹 Support Overhang Angle
•	Support Overhang Angle: 55°
(PLA bridges well — this reduces unnecessary supports)
________________________________________
🔹 Support Interface (KEY TO EASY REMOVAL)
Enable Support Interface ✅
•	Enable Support Interface: ON
•	Support Interface Thickness: 0.6 mm
•	Support Interface Density: 60–70%
•	Support Interface Pattern: Lines
•	Support Roof: ON
•	Support Floor: OFF (usually unnecessary)
➡️ Dense interface + sparse support body = strong support that snaps off cleanly.
________________________________________
🔹 Z Distance (MOST IMPORTANT)
These control how easily supports detach.
•	Support Z Distance: 0.24 mm
(Exactly 1 layer for your 0.24–0.28 mm profiles)
•	Support Top Distance: 0.24 mm
•	Support Bottom Distance: 0.24 mm
💡 If supports stick too much → increase to 0.28 mm
If they fail → reduce to 0.20 mm
________________________________________
🔹 X/Y Distance (Side Separation)
•	Support X/Y Distance: 0.8 mm
This prevents fusing on vertical surfaces.
________________________________________
🔹 Support Horizontal Expansion
•	Support Horizontal Expansion: –0.2 mm
Creates a small air gap so supports don’t weld to walls.
________________________________________
🔹 Support Wall Settings
•	Support Wall Line Count: 0–1
•	Support Wall Line Width: 0.4 mm
Fewer walls = easier removal.
________________________________________
🔹 Support Speed (Slower = Cleaner Break)
•	Support Print Speed: 60 mm/s
•	Support Interface Speed: 45 mm/s
________________________________________
🔹 Cooling & Temp (Helps Separation)
•	Support Fan Speed: 100%
•	Support Interface Fan Speed: 100%
•	Support Material Temperature:
→ Same as model or –5 °C if Cura allows override
________________________________________
🛠 OPTIONAL QUALITY TWEAKS
For REALLY Easy Removal (Cosmetic Parts)
•	Support Density: 8–10%
•	Support Z Distance: 0.28–0.32 mm
•	Support Interface Density: 50–60%
For Heavy Overhangs (Functional Parts)
•	Support Density: 12–15%
•	Support Interface Density: 70–80%
•	Keep Z Distance at 0.24 mm
________________________________________
📌 Recommended Combo (Most Prints)
If you want a single “set and forget” configuration:
•	Lines
•	12% density
•	Support Interface ON
•	0.24 mm Z distance
•	–0.2 mm horizontal expansion
➡️ Supports will snap off in chunks, not crumble or fuse.
________________________________________
🚨 Common Mistakes
❌ Grid supports (too strong)
❌ Z distance = 0 (welds supports)
❌ High density + no interface
❌ Printing supports too hot
________________________________________
If you want, I can:
•	Tune supports per profile (draft vs fine detail)
•	Give tree support settings (even easier removal for organic shapes)
•	Create a “support-only” Cura profile you can import
Just tell me 👍
